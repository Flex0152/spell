## General
I often have to spell things over the phone. To avoid misunderstandings, I created this small program.
It takes any text input and returns it spelled out.
Both the NATO and the German spelling alphabets are available.
Additionally, the output behavior can be controlled with the parameter "end".
If an empty string "" is passed, the result will be output in a single line.
